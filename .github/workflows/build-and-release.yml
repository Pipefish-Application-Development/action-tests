#
# The Continous Deployment workflow
#
# This workflow is trigged in a push to main (after a PR)
# and initiates the build and release process.
#
# We automatically deploy to the development environment,
# then, after approvals enforced by GitHub Environment Approvals
# we move to QA and then onto production environments.
